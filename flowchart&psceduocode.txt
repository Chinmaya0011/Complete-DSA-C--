Flowchart:

A flowchart is like a map that shows the steps of a process
 or a program using shapes and symbols. It helps us understand how things flow from one step to another, making it easier to follow along.

e.g-
Start
↓
Input length and width of the rectangle
↓
Calculate area = length × width
↓
Output area
↓
End



Pseudocode:

Pseudocode is like writing down the steps of a solution in plain English, without worrying about the exact programming language syntax.
 It's a way to plan out how to solve a problem before writing actual code.

e.g-
Start

// Input
Prompt user for length of the rectangle
Read length

Prompt user for width of the rectangle
Read width

// Calculation
area = length * width

// Output
Display area

End
